# Changelog

## 2026-06-13

### Built Dynamic Economic Calendar via Next.js API
- Created `app/api/econ-calendar/events.json` — persistent data file, source of truth for all pages
- Created `app/api/econ-calendar/route.ts` — GET serves events.json; POST writes new events to disk
- Updated `Vanilla/pages/overview/overview.js` — `ECON_EVENTS` now fetched from `/api/econ-calendar` on load instead of hardcoded
- Updated `Vanilla/economic-calendar-importer.js` — after parsing JSON or OCR screenshot, POSTs events to API to persist permanently; falls back gracefully if server write fails

### Updated Economic Calendar (overview.js)
- Replaced week of June 8–12 events with June 15–19 week
- **Mon Jun 15:** Empire State Mfg Survey, Industrial Production, Capacity Utilization, NAHB Housing Index
- **Tue Jun 16:** Housing Starts, Import Prices
- **Wed Jun 17:** Retail Sales, Mfg & Trade Inventories, Pending Home Sales, U.S. Interest Rate Decision
- **Thu Jun 18:** Weekly Jobless Claims, Philly Fed Business Outlook, Leading Indicators
- **Fri Jun 19:** No events scheduled
